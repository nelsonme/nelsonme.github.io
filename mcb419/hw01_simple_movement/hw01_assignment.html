<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this assignment you will create a single bot that moves around the arena in a circular path. The resulting simulation will look something like this:</p>

<h2>Specifications</h2>
<p>The arena is 400 x 400 pixels.<br />
The bot is drawn as a yellow circle with a radius of 20 pixels.<br />
The bot has a solid line indicating its heading direction.</p>

<p>The bot’s <em>initial</em> conditions:<br />
<strong>x</strong>: 50 pixels from the right edge of the arena<br />
<strong>y</strong>: half way down the arena<br />
<strong>heading</strong>: facing the bottom of the arena</p>

<p>The bot’s movement:<br />
<strong>speed</strong>: the bot moves at a constant speed of 3 pixels/tick<br />
<strong>heading</strong>: on each tick, the heading should be incremented by a fixed amount,
then the bot should be moved by 3 units in that direction. The resulting change in x and y position are given by:<br />
dx = speed * cos(heading)<br />
dy = speed * sin(heading) <br />
<strong>trajectory</strong>: the bot should move along a circular path with a diameter of 300 pixels. This will be accomplished by incrementing the bot’s heading direction by a fixed amount on each tick. You will need to compute the value for the amount to increment the heading. To do so, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>what is the circumference of a cirlce with a diameter of 300 pixels?</li>
  <li>if the bot moves a 3 pixels per tick, how many ticks are required to move along the full circumference of the circle?</li>
  <li>when the bot completes the circle it’s heading will have gone through a change of 2π radians. Knowing the number of ticks required to complete the circle should let you calculate the change in heading per tick.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Edit Bot.js</strong> you will need to provide code for reset(), update() and draw()</li>
  <li><strong>Edit sketch.js</strong> you will need to create the bot and call the reset, update and draw methods at appropriate locations in the code</li>
  <li><strong>Save</strong> your changes</li>
  <li><strong>Repeat editing, debugging, saving</strong> until things are working properly</li>
  <li><strong>Click “Check implementation” button</strong> to test your code</li>
</ul>
